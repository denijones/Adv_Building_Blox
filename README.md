# Adv_Building_Blox

Completed two tasks as presented by The Odin Project. 


1. 

Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. 

Now create a similar method called #bubble_sort_by which sorts an array but accepts a block. The block should take two arguments which represent the two elements currently being compared. Expect that the block's return will be similar to the spaceship operator you learned about before -- if the result of the block is negative, the element on the left is "smaller" than the element on the right. 0 means they are equal. A positive result means the left element is greater. 

2. 

Rebuild enumerable modules.

#each
#each_index
#select
#all?
#any?
#none?
#count
#map
#inject
